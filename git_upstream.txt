Git upstream is best understood in the context of forks where there is an 'master' repository version and then your own fork
The fork is your 'origin' repository and the 'upstream' is the master remote repository you ultimately want to push too
Upstream remotes are a way to have your local fork tracked and ultimately pushed through a pull request to the master repository
