Git clone replicates a remote, online repository from Github in your local desktop
It creates a remote that can push too
Interestingly, when you clone an empty repository (e.g. Octocat) after you commit you get a message of "Your branch is based on 'origin/master', but the upstream is gone
To solve this, you have to 'git push origin/master' so that establishes a master branch in the remote repository that wouldn't have existed before due to it being empty
